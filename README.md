PSA This repo exploits a bug in git.io service, which has now been fixed and hence this repo code no longer works as described.

# Git.io Shortener Hack
Shorten any url to git.io http://sauravtom.com/gitiohack


Git.io is a service by github.com to shorten only github.com urls.
This repo extends that service to any url.
